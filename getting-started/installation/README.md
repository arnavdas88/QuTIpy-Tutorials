# Installation

## Quick install guide

Before you can use QuTIpy, you’ll need to get it installed. We have a [complete installation guide](install-with-git.md) that covers all the possibilities; this guide will guide you to a minimal installation that’ll work while you walk through the introduction.

### Install Python

Being a Python computing framework, QuTIpy requires Python.

Get the latest version of Python at [https://www.python.org/downloads/](https://www.python.org/downloads/) or with your operating system’s package manager.

You can verify that Python is installed by typing `python` from your shell; you should see something like:

```
Python 3.x.y
[GCC 4.x] on linux
Type "help", "copyright", "credits" or "license" for more information.
>>>
```

### Install QuTIpy

You’ve got three options to install QuTIpy:

* [Install an official release](https://github.com/sumeetkhatri/QuTIpy/releases). This is the best approach for most users.
* [Install the latest development version](https://github.com/sumeetkhatri/QuTIpy). This option is for enthusiasts who want the latest-and-greatest features and aren’t afraid of running brand new code. You might encounter new bugs in the development version, but reporting them helps the development of QuTIpy. Also, releases of third-party packages are less likely to be compatible with the development version than with the latest stable release.
